## Include basic info:
* Name: your name
* Course: SEP10 (Web Design) / SEP11 (Javascript) / APCSA (Java)
* Concept: HTML elements, JS basics, primitives and objects, etc.
* Context: general info before you explain technical concepts/details

## Include your _process_ of learning code recently:
* Examples: what you're learning, how you're learning, mistakes you've made, how you've overcome them, takeaway/a-ha moments, next steps, etc.
* Not just explaining correct code, but HOW you got there. Think out loud!

## Grade Breakdown
* 10% Context
  * General information before you dive deep into challenges, code, etc.
* 30% Challenges
  * Explain what was challenging and how you overcame the challenge. Be specific! Include code snippets.
* 20% Takeaways (must be rooted in examples given). Can be technical and/or non-technical:
  * Technical: code-based
    * Example: "You can make an image clickable by putting the `<img>`` INSIDE the opening/closing tags of `<a></a>``."
    * Example: "The words between the opening and closing tags of an element will appear on the web page. Everything that is inside the opening tag is behind the scenes."
    * Example: "Radio buttons have to have the same name in order to be linked together."
  * Non-technical: skills-based
    * Example: "I need to take better notes. When I was doing the coding challenge, I had a hard time finding the specific tags I was looking for, so I had to dig through the FreeCodeCamp lessons. On the other hand, Sanila and Rajab had really organized notes, and they were able to complete the challenge really quickly. I am inspired by them."
    * Example: "In class, I decided to ask a question about where to put the `id` for an internal link, and now I understand how it works. So I think I'll be asking more questions from now on."
    * Example: "It's ok to ask for help on Slack. I noticed that Emily asked about indented lists, and Vivian helped her (I was struggling with the same thing). If Emily never asked, I probably would have been stuck too. Next time, I'll be the one to ask."
* 20% Code snippets have backticks & language
* 10% Formatting (other markdown: heading(s), list(s), bold, italic, etc)
* 10% No typos
