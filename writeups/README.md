* This is a living document. It is subject to change. But you'll want to be able to come back to find it.

## What is a writeup
* **For YOU**: A place to process what you're learning WHILE you're learning it
  * "I already understand this" 
    * Processing will help you understand it deeper AND help solidify the short-term into long-term understanding. If it feels like busywork, you're doing it wrong. 
  * "I kind of understand this."
    * You are in the sweet spot. Processing will REALLY help you understand this.
  * "I don't understand this at all" 
    * You MUST ask for help, THEN process! Otherwise you will fall behind
  * Still confused: get unstuck! Slack, tutoring, jsbin
* **For TEACHER**: A sneak peek into your brain

## How to do a writeup
* Context
* Organization is up to you
  * Rich task(s)/concept(s) with challenges/takeaways throughout
    * Concept by concept
    * Challenge by challenge
  * A narrative of the topic, with challenges/takeaways at the end
* Summary/Takeaways should be specific
  * Content-based, i.e.
> I learned how to make a clickable link using `<a><img></a>`
*
  * Skills-based, i.e.
> It's important to ask for help. I asked ___ for help about ___ and they ___ and so I ___
