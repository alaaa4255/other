# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Visual Arts)
##### 10/18/21

## Choosing a topic

The topic I decided on for this project is visual arts due to the fact that I’ve always been passionate about this subject. Since I was interested in visual art for as long as I could remember, it’s not that surprising that I would want to try to find a new way to incorporate technology into this topic. I considered making this project about education or baking, but I soon decided that art would be the best choice. Although I didn’t pick these ideas, researching them was very enjoyable. Some of my favorite articles about these topics include ["Use of Technology in Teaching and Learning"](https://oese.ed.gov/archived/oii/use-of-technology-in-teaching-and-learning/) by the U.S. Department of Education, ["How new technologies impact your business"](https://www.tastetomorrow.com/inspiration/how-new-technologies-impact-your-business) by Taste Tomorrow, and ["How Does New Technology in Bakeries Affect the Workplace?"](https://work.chron.com/new-technology-bakeries-affect-workplace-19878.html) by Chron. All articles were very interesting and informative, but the piece of text that made me the most inclined to pick visual art was ["The Growing Relationship between Art and Technology"](https://education.christies.com/news/2019/may/growing-relationship-between-art-technology) by Christie’s Education. Seeing all of the different ways new technology has been implemented in art was truly fascinating and made me even more passionate about visual art than I already was. 

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **people are not informed about the world of technology in visual art**. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation. 

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as picking up my brother from school every day, being on a swim team, and being in a gaming club two days a week. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for this project as well as my history class. So I decided to cut back from two days of gaming club per week to just one day per week. I think this change will help moving forward.

#### How to Google

When I Googled _visual arts technology_, obviously I'm not going to look through all 608 million results. But skimming the titles and descriptions was helpful, as I wasn't really concerned with college degrees or Instagram accounts. Instead, seeing titles of articles like ["How Technology is Changing Visual Art"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/personaltech/technology-visual-art.html) was more along the lines of what I wanted to find. Plus, changing my search from _visual arts technology_ to _visual arts technology innovations_ also filtered the results down to what I wanted to find.

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching the existing innovations in visual arts!

# Entry 1: Architecture, building the road ahead
##### 10/18/21

## Why architecture?

The topic that I have chosen for the year-long project is **architecture**. I chose this topic because I love to study different kinds of architecture/buildings and the process of making it. I am obsessed with the different styles of architecture and want to know more about it, especially all kinds of old style ones. There is a Hot-Pot Restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and the design of the restaurant looked awesome. It is one of those kinds of Chinese old style designs. I liked to see how the architecture over there plans these things out and know the process of architecturing and what kinds of technologies they use to do these beautiful architectures. Lastly, my two backup ideas are educational and graphic designs. 

The two main links that I used to explore was [10 Signs That You Should Become an Architect](https://www.mymove.com/home-inspiration/decoration-design-ideas/signs-that-you-should-become-an-architect/#:~:text=Being%20an%20architect%20is%20more,important%2C%20the%20ability%20to%20design.) and [How Technology Is Transforming Architectural Design](https://www.alvarezdiazvillalon.com/how-technology-is-transforming-architectural-design). The first link helps me know what the field architecture is. And the second link tells me what technologies are used in the field of Architecture. Some other links that I had explored were [What Tools Does an Architect Use?](https://work.chron.com/tools-architect-use-10408.html) and [25 Tools and Devices for Architects — Journey of an Architect](https://www.journeyofanarchitect.com/blog/25-tools-and-devices-for-architects). These two were links that helped me understand the intro of architecturing and what were devices/technology that were helpful in architecture. 

## EDP

Now, I am on the (Step 1) defining and the (Step 2) researching step of the EDP (engineering design process). At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that career. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of architecture are “3D printers, augmented writing, and virtual reality.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills

One skill that I learned during this experience is **How to Google**. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I looked up "architecture innovations," I found a lot of cool stuff, but it wasn't necessarily technology. A lot of it was design-related, such as repurposing shipping containers for things like gardens or homes. So I had to add the word "technology" to my search and that really helped me confirm that I'm interested in existing and also future technology of architecture.

Another skill that I also achieved was **How to Read**. After googling, we needed to see which article matches with the topic by reading closely. There were a lot of terms I didn't know, such as "CAD" (which I then Googled, and that ties into my first skill. By the way, it means "computer aided design"). But reading an article is a lot different than reading a novel. A lot of articles have headings and subheadings that break up the text into smaller chunks, making it easier to read. I think that also helps me in the way that I write, for example, I added headings to this blog entry so that hopefully it's easier for you to read!

## Summary

Overall, I'm really excited to make a website about the technology of architecture. It all started with the inspiration of a restaurant in Fort Hamilton, and maybe I'll have a future career in architecture!
