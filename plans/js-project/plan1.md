# JS Project

## Members
* Brian
* Ryan

## Plan (breaking down the task)
* `alert` welcome, `prompt` for the user's name (Brian)
* an `array` of adjectives, one for each letter in the alphabet (Ryan)
* `function` that takes in a name and gives back an adjective using alliteration: with the same starting letter (Brian)
* `document.write` the user's new "nickname" using string concatenation (Ryan)
* use a `conditional` to print a bonus `if` their name is Brian (both)

## Timeline
* Tuesday: plan!
* Wednesday: difficult tasks (Ryan adjectives `array` and Brian alliteration `function`)
* Thursday: easy tasks (Brian `alert`/`prompt` and Ryan `document.write`/`+`), and merge code together
* Friday: add the "Brian" `conditional`, and fix any bugs
